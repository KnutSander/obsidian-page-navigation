# Obsidian Page Navigation Plugin

This is a simple plugin to automatically create links between pages.

The idea is to automatically create a link back to the page the new page was created from. This functionality is implemented at this point, but it has several flaws and areas for improvement.

## List of Improvements
- Allow users to configure the header for the navgation, currently is always "Navigation"
- More configuration options
- Automatically update navigation list if a folder with the same name exists, listing the files in the folder

## List of Known Bugs
- If content is not addedd to new file not created by a link, the next time it is opened a link will be created
