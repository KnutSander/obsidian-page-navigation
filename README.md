# Obsidian Page Navigation Plugin

This is a simple plugin to automatically create links between pages.

The idea is to automatically create a link back to the page the new page was created from. This functionality is implemented at this point, but it has several flaws and areas for improvement.

## List of Improvements
- Allow users to configure the header for the navgation, currently is always "Navigation"

## List of Known Bugs
- Link is created regardless of what method the new page was created by. Need to only create one when a page is created by clicking a link.
