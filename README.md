# Obsidian Page Navigation Plugin

This is a simple plugin to automatically create links between pages.

The idea is to automatically create a link back to the page the new page was created from. This functionality is implemented at this point, but it has several flaws and areas for improvement.

## List of Improvements
- Allow users to configure the header for the navgation, currently is always "Navigation"
- More configuration options

## List of Known Bugs
- Creating new file using mouse causes links to appear when they shouldn't
